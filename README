FEM analysis of 1-D second order ordinary differential equation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program solves the 1-D second order ordinary differential equation:
a d2u/dx2 + b du/dx + c u = f, u(0) = 0, a du/dx at (x = L) = q
where, both u and f are function of x only. This package is mainly intended for
educational purpose, and it introduces a general concept on discretization, 
Gauss quadrature, stiffness matrix, boundary conditions, and matrix solution.

HISTORY
  Oct 24,2006, HNG: original package created
  Apr 25,2017, HNG: modified package 

COMPILE:
	- go to parent folder
	- type: make
RUN:
	./bin/fem1d input_file
  EXAMPLE:
  ./bin/fem1d ./input/example.fem

INPUT:
  - Input file has the following format:

  #----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Define the 1D second order differential equation: 
  # a d2u/dx2 + b du/dx + c u = f, u(0) = 0, a du/dx at (x = L) = q
  # where, both u and f are function of x only
  a: 1.0  
  b: 0.0
  c: 1.0
  f: 10.0

  # Define mesh
  Length: 10.0
  Number of elements: 4
  Number of nodes per element: 3

  # Define boundary conditions.
  # u0 => u(0) and qL => q(L).
  u0: 0.0
  qL: 10.0

  # Compute and save also the exact result for
  # a=1, b=0, c=-1, f=10, u0=0, qL=10, L=10
  # 1: yes, 0: no
  Compute and save exact result: 1 
  #----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
  - please see ./input/example.fem file.

OUTPUT:
	- computed and analytical (if pexact=1) results can be plotted using plot.dat
    or plotTP.dat files. The later file can be viewed in TecPlot. 
    Note that analytical result is currently computed precisely for the 
    following parameters: a=1, b=0, c=-1, f=10, u0=0, qL=10, L=10
