# Define the 1D second order differential equation: 
# a d2u/dx2 + b du/dx + c u = f, u(0) = 0, a du/dx at (x = L) = q
# where, both u and f are function of x only
a: 1.0  
b: 0.0
c: -1.0
f: 10.0

# Define mesh
Length: 10.0
Number of elements: 4
Number of nodes per element: 3

# Define boundary conditions.
# u0 => u(0) and qL => q(L).
u0: 0.0
qL: 10.0

# Compute and save also the exact result for
# a=1, b=0, c=-1, f=10, u0=0, qL=10, L=10
# 1: yes, 0: no
Compute and save exact result: 1
